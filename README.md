# adc-overflow
This code base is used to search for ADC/DAC overflows in LIGO instruments.
Developed by TJ Massinger for use in the LVC.

The purpose of this code is to generate an appropriate set of condor dag and sub files to search for ADC/DAC overflows and generate sngl_burst XML files containing triggers.
